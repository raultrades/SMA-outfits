## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to organizing the structure of the utility of Simple Moving Average (SMA) Outfits in public equity markets and controlled system's impact on wealth distribution. Simple Moving Average Outfits are the core operations of the United States Equity Markets' blackbox systems. The following information examines the AI-assisted decision-making processes that effectively create all principal market behaviors. This information details the specific tools utilized by the largest aggressive wealth conglomerates, with sophisticated trading divisions, to provide liquidity, enable domestic and international market efficiency, and function in a manner intended to manipulate the market. It is crucial to recognize that the data presented here directly informs global financial strategies, rewards long-term market participants, and is the fulcrum of the American financial system. This strategic integration ensures that every significant market action is underpinned by data-driven, algorithmically enhanced decision-making, that reflect the sophistication and precision of modern financial engineering.

## Overview

SMA outfits fundamentally dictate when and where the largest equity managers direct liquidity, thus operating the flow of capital that shapes the entire market structure. The precision and application of SMA outfits are critical, considering every Stock Market transaction is influenced by these configurations. Clear and actionable signals with incredible precision ensure that all market participants can operate with full awareness of market conditions, which quite literally forge market efficiency.

For those new to financial markets, it is an extreme leap to understand the magnitude of capital that is mobilized through public equity markets. These "outfits" are not optional elements, instead are core components that are what have prompted effective markets since the start of automated quotations in the NASDAQ. This repository should serve to set the stage for layman, academics, mathematicians, quantitative researches, and regulatory bodies to have full unabridged access to the global financial system catalyzed by financiers of the United States of America.

## Methodology

This research relies on high-precision data sourced primarily from desktop Lightspeed (brokerage) and Webull platforms, both of which are known for their near-total accuracy in data provision. However, periodic data inconsistencies have been observed with Webull, notably on March 18th, 2024, which involved data discrepancies potentially linked to cache errors. Lightspeed Broker has consistently delivered accurate data barring isolated incidents directly attributed to errors from the NYSE or NASDAQ. To manage and store the extensive volume of historical price action data required for this analysis, InfluxDB was employed due to its robust data handling capabilities. The InfluxDB system was chosen for its efficiency in storing time-series data, allowing for rapid queries and retrieval necessary for the rapid real-time nature of equity market analysis. This setup ensures that all data used is normalized and processed with the highest standards of accuracy, serving as the backbone for all subsequent analytical tasks.

All data handling and trading practices detailed within this research strictly comply with relevant financial regulations and data protection laws, including GDPR, SEC regulations, and other applicable standards, ensuring integrity and legality in all operational aspects.

### Data Handling and Analysis Framework

The SMA calculation engine relies on a dual-source input system, incorporating real-time and historical market data from **Lightspeed** and **Webull**, two renowned trading platforms known for their precision and reliability in data provision.

#### Data Sources and Integration

- **Lightspeed**: Known for its robustness and favored by professional traders, Lightspeed provides high-frequency data that includes every trade, quote, and order book change. This data is critical for developing real-time SMA calculations that can respond instantaneously to market movements.
- **Webull**: Offers comprehensive market data that includes not only transactional information but also extensive metadata on trading instruments, which is vital for contextual analysis in SMA calculations.
- **JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**: This format is used for its flexibility and ease of integration with web technologies. JSON structures allow for a detailed representation of nested data, which is particularly useful for encapsulating the various attributes of market data, such as timestamps, prices, volumes, and metadata.
- **CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**: This format is employed for its simplicity and efficiency in handling large datasets that are typical in historical data analysis. CSV formats are particularly advantageous for batch processing and long-term historical analysis, where data manipulation and storage efficiency are paramount.

#### Pre-processing for SMA Calculation Readiness

To maintain the highest standards of data quality and consistency, the following pre-processing steps are implemented:

- **Data Cleansing**: The initial step involves scrubbing the data to remove or correct data anomalies that could skew SMA calculations. This includes:
  - Removing any records with null or missing values in critical fields such as timestamps or prices.
  - Identifying and correcting outliers that fall outside of a statistically reasonable range, possibly due to data entry errors or system glitches.

- **Timestamp Normalization**: Given the global nature of financial markets, data from various sources may come with different time zones. All timestamps are converted to a uniform timezone (EST) to maintain consistency across the dataset. Additionally, timestamps are normalized to the highest resolution needed for real-time trading decisions, typically to the millisecond, to ensure precise alignment in time-series analysis.

#### Filtering Incomplete Data
- Entries that do not meet the complete information criteria, such as those missing essential metadata like trade volume or instrument type, are filtered out to ensure the reliability of the SMA outputs. This includes entries with zero, negative, or unrealistically low prices that might indicate data errors or placeholder values used during data entry mishaps.
- Data entries that lack timestamp information, which are critical for placing the price in a temporal context are omitted.
- Missing crucial metadata like stock ticker symbols, market identifiers, or other descriptors that prevent clear association with specific trading instruments are adjusted.
- Sudden spikes or drops in price or volume that do not align with known market behaviors or news events, suggesting potential data errors that deviate significantly from a moving average or median value and do not correlate with market events are omitted.

#### Data Consistency Checks
- Consistency checks are performed to ensure that data across different sources aligns correctly. For example, price data from Lightspeed is cross-verified with Webull data for the same instruments at the same timestamps. Discrepancies are logged and investigated to maintain a high integrity data set.
- Identical entries recorded multiple times due to data entry errors or system glitches. These duplicates can artificially inflate the importance of a single data point within the SMA calculation.

##### Error Handling
- Robust error handling mechanisms are built to address data feed interruptions or anomalies dynamically. This includes fallback procedures to retrieve data from alternative sources or to use the last known good data point as a placeholder until the feed is restored.

#### Data Integration
- Data from various sources is integrated into a unified format within a staging area before final storage in InfluxDB. This involves aligning data fields, both harmonizing and isolating data formats, and consolidating records to prepare for efficient querying and analysis.

A SMA calculation engine ensures that the data fed into the system is of the highest quality, providing accurate market analysis. The SMA calculations support both scalability and adaptability for Data Processing.
 
#### Data Processing

Data processing is the core operational phase where raw market data is transformed into actionable insights through SMA calculations and trading signal generation. This stage is crucial for implementing trading strategies based on the calculated SMA values.

#### Computational Algorithms
- **SMA Calculations**: Implement algorithms to calculate Simple Moving Averages over various time windows as specified by the user or system requirements. This involves computing the average of stock prices over a set number of past data points continuously as new data comes in.
- **Signal Generation**: Develop algorithms that analyze SMA lines for typical trading signals such as crossovers. A signal is generated when a short-term SMA crosses above (buy signal) or below (sell signal) a long-term SMA, indicating potential market movements.
- **Algorithm Complexity**: Manage the complexity of these algorithms to handle large datasets without degrading performance, ensuring that calculations can keep pace with real-time data flow.

#### Performance Optimization
- **Resource Management**: Optimize the use of computational resources to process data efficiently, minimizing latency, which is essential in high-frequency trading environments.
- **Parallel Processing**: Implement parallel processing techniques where feasible, especially for computationally intensive tasks like real-time SMA recalculations across multiple instruments.
- **Caching Strategies**: Utilize advanced caching mechanisms to store interim computational results, reducing redundancy in calculations and speeding up response times for frequently requested data in order to implement real time executions.

### Integrating SMA Outfits with OHLC Data

To operationalize SMA outfits effectively, our algorithms integrate cleaned and processed OHLC data to detect specific patterns aligned with predefined SMA configurations. This integration is pivotal for identifying trade opportunities based on real-time market behaviors.

#### Frequency Detection and Trigger Mechanisms

- **Frequency Detection**: Algorithms scan OHLC data for frequency patterns that align with the SMA outfits, identifying precision trading operations that have a historical repertoire in real time.
- **Trigger Mechanism**: Upon detecting a historically operated pattern, advanced arbitrage outfit detection systems automatically trigger buying and/or selling protocols, executing trades based on precise, real-time analysis of SMA, OHLC, Timeframe data intersections.

By refining computational algorithms and optimizing performance, the data processing stage ensures that trading strategies based on SMA calculations are both reliable and timely, capable of operating effectively in real time market environments.

## Background and Research
The exploration of the significance of the integer Three in public equities initiated a year-long academic inquiry, encompassing areas such as quantum mechanics, cryptography, mathematical abstractions, and logic. This journey was informed by the foundational contributions of Alan Turing to current mathematical pedagogy. In the course of this scholarly pursuit, the research encountered the seminal works of Edward Waring and David Hilbert, two mathematicians whose theories have profoundly influenced the field of mathematics and computer science. It was within this context that the researcher discovered the conjecture known as David Hilbert's Waring's Problem.

WARING'S PROBLEM is a profound natural number theory conjecture. In layman terms it explores proof that every number can be broken down into a certain type of smaller number. More importantly, if every number can be expressed using a limited set of patterns. That is where you get the integers 19/37/73/143/279/548 that, for the sake of simplicity apparently are the six integers global wealth operators have elected to use as one of the SMA outfits. This effective research, in conjunction with heuristic (trial based, rule based frameworks) search and brute-force (systematic probing of combinations) application of Waring's Problem integers, evolved into a method of empirical optimization that further refined my investigative approach.

Given my academic background in sociology I wasn't taken aback to learn that the machinations of the U.S. financial project are meant to be complicated. The facade of finance is premised on the reality that the Elite, Capitalist beneficiaries, Public who work to live and contribute to an IRA/Pension/401K/Taxes, and International Subjects rely on this sophisticated system. My research focused immediately on identifying the technical foundation of the public equity markets, recognizing it as a multi-millionaire, multi-billionaire, and multi-trillion dollar economic growth and exploitation project.

Detailed below are the procedures and selection process governed by exceptionally intricate parameters. These parameters, despite their complexity, facilitate straightforward visualization, documentation, and real-time recording. The proof here is what has garnered the public's reception. Public equities are a product of a multidisciplinary combination of data science, software engineering integrating Data Acquisition from real time & historical market data, broker API integration, & real time selections.

There is a more singular breakdown that should be addressed and asserted. Consider the SMA outfits as singular and explicit proof that, backed by ten of thousands of instances of real time data recently made public, under critical scrutiny by agencies of intelligence and regulatory bodies, points to the financial ecosystem plainly reflecting our socio-cultural construct. Consider that any understanding of wealth is tied to symbols and meaning of which we as people imbue in numbers. While the selection of specific SMA parameters may be technically arbitrary, it is the precision and consistency of these chosen configurations that have been proven to facilitate and document substantial wealth transfer via the financial markets. These SMA configurations are chosen by intelligence agencies to add complexity and flexibility, allowing only well-informed and strategic financial firms to benefit significantly and collaboratively. 



## Technical Explanation
Simple Moving Average (SMA) outfits are sets of predetermined SMAs that institutions with aggressive trading divisions use as triggers for executing trades in high volume liquid trading vehicles (stocks). A Simple Moving Average (SMA) is a technical analysis tool that calculates the average OHLC (open, high, low, close) prices, over a certain number of periods. Each outfit consists of multiple SMAs with different time periods.  By employing SMA outfits effectively on multiple vehicles, large financial institutions with aggressive trading divisions maximize on every singular point shift in the public equity markets. Since these institutions manage vast sums of money, their trades move the market in the direction of their trades, effectively redistributing wealth to aggressive trading divisions and eventually long-term market participants.

### Parameter Limitation
The parameter set for SMA outfits is strictly maintained between 1 and 999 to preserve these benefits across all trading platforms and scenarios. This boundary not only supports a structured and simplified analysis framework but also ensures that all market participants can engage with the data in a clear and organized manner. Standardizing SMA parameters within this range ensures uniformity across different markets and asset classes, allowing trading divisions and algorithms to apply consistent operations whether trading stocks, forex, cryptocurrencies, or commodities. This uniformity simplifies the development and implementation of automated trading systems, reducing complexity and enhancing reliability. Algorithms from advanced trading divisions benefit from a standardized approach, which supports more straightforward programming, rigorous testing, and effective execution of trading. By avoiding extremes the data remains relevant and actionable without succumbing to redundancy or irrelevance.

### Executive Definitions

This section provides detailed definitions of key terms and strategies used in the context of SMA operations and trading algorithms. Understanding these definitions will aid in understanding the behavior of the market as directly influenced by SMA outfits.

#### Precision Buying Algorithm
A **Precision Buying Algorithm** is performed by advanced trading systems that leverage both historical market data and real-time conditions, and sophisticated statistical analyses. The primary function of Precision Buying Algorithms are to stimulate capital in and out of the public equity markets by rigorously analyzing patterns and specific price points within Open, High, Low, and Close (OHLC) market data. The core mechanism of these algorithms involves the detection of precise market conditions triggered by specific Simple Moving Average (SMA) outfit selections. This occurs particularly after a market drawdown, where firms with leading algorithm detection tools identify a collaborative and historically relevant arbitrage opportunity. This operation ensures continuity in market conditions that aggressive trading divisions exploit for sustained engagement or the maximization of returns through precisely timed intervention. In practice, a precision buying algorithm activates when an arbitrage detection system identifies a precision OHLC relationship within a singular timeframe, singular equity, and singular SMA Outfit that has been historically or statistically significant following an SMA-induced drawdown. This SMA selection serves as a critical signal that conditions are primed for a profitable buying operation. The algorithm then executes buy orders at these meticulously calculated moments from the second of its selection, in order to capitalize on rapid price movement, thus optimizing capital gains. The operational success of these algorithms is fundamentally reliant on extreme liquidity in the vehicle, the system's ability to discern and act upon these finely-tuned market cues, ensuring high precision in the timing and execution of the budgeted selection. This precision in targeting exact price points ensures the reliability of public equity markets. The technical efficacy achieved through precise SMA outfit detection and historical operations ensures that trading division maximize from algorithmic thresholds, not on perceived inefficiencies or unpredictable market sentiments.

#### Automated Short Orders
An **Automated Short Order** involves the placement of trades to sell securities that are not currently owned by the seller, but borrowed, with the intention to repurchase shares at a lower price. This trading strategy hinges on the anticipation of a price decline, which is facilitated by the SMA outfits designed to analyze specific OHLC patterns and market indicators that facilitate impending drops in stock prices. Automated Short Orders, or Precision Short Orders, are executed by high-frequency trading programs that capitalize on rapid, real-time market movements. These programs are finely calibrated to detect arbitrage opportunities and are functionally deployed by wealth conglomerates possessing substantial capital. This allows them to effectively manipulate market trends and maximize profits. The initiation of Automated Short Orders are critically dependent on systems interpreting market data, more specifically the SMA outfits, ensuring that trades are placed at the precise moment optimal conditions are detected, thereby enhancing profitability and market influence.

#### Singular Point Hard Stop Order
A **Singular Point Hard Stop Order** is a predetermined price level at which a trading position must be closed automatically. The Singular Point Hard Stop Order component is integral to the operation of precision Buying Algorithms and Automated Short Orders. By enforcing the execution of trades with rigorously calculated precision, Singular Point Hard Stop Orders operate to control high volume equity pivots in price action. This action automatically liquidates positions on a singular penny or "point" breach of a Precision Buying Algorithm to facilitate a swift execution of sell orders that maximize on price declines. Singular Point Hard Stop Orders are only operable due to the combination of liquidity in public equity markets and access to darkpool trading. This level of precision enables advanced trading divisions to execute and liquidate orders at the precise moment a singular point of penny breach occurs on a Precision Buying Algorithm or Automated Short Order, optimizing trade execution down to the millisecond.

#### Optimized Buying Algorithms
An **Optimized Buying Algorithm** is an advanced trading protocol designed to operate at the highest levels of precision. These algorithms are a product of highly optimized procedures within the context of SMA (Simple Moving Average) outfits. Optimization is the systematic process of adjusting algorithmic parameters for cryptographic sophistication. This tuning of technique is necessary for firms to operate within the limits of regulatory frameworks and to mask operations from conventional regulatory oversight. Optimization involves subtle adjustments, or refinement, that can outperform even the best high-frequency detection systems.

**Magnetized Buying Programs** are designed to strategically attract buy orders to a specific price level on a SMA outfit. These programs optimize order placements where real-time market-making activity is concentrated, specifically with a disproportionate tabulation of OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) entries that reflect a relationship to a singular SMA outfit. This practice of **Magnetizing Orders** is to ensure minimal slippage and an optimal execution.

In contrast to Precision Buying Algorithms and Singular Point Hard Stop Orders, which focus on exact entry points and rigid execution parameters, Optimized Buying Algorithms are designed to be more adaptive. Case studies have demonstrated that Optimized Buying Algorithms operate during periods of heightened volatility that advanced trading divisions use to gamify equities based on historical relevance.

#### Dark Pools
**Dark Pools** are institutional private trading routes that allow institutional trading divisions to access liquidity in order to trade large blocks of securities. Dark Pools or "Dark Assault Routes" preserves trading exposure to the public markets to minimize market impact for large transactions. This specific anonymity provided by Dark Pools allow for extreme discretion  for aggressive wealth firms to capitalize on and execute Precision Buying Algorithms, Automated Short Orders, and Singular Point Hard Stop Orders using the SMA outfits. The reduced impact of visible volume in the public markets ensure that significant trades can be executed precisely at singular point or penny entries or breaches without often without immediate impact. Dark Pools inherently obscure specific trading activity; breaches of precision Singular Point Hard Stop Orders are followed by large volume candles as substantial trading decisions have already been executed beyond the typical market view. Detailed examples will follow in subsequent sections, providing explicit demonstrations of market activities and these specific trading mechanisms.

#### Institutional Hour Session
The **Institutional Hour Session** is the standard trading hours when major stock exchanges are active, typically between 9:30 AM and 4:00 PM Eastern Standard Time (EST). During these hours, trading volumes are higher, and the market operates on robust liquidity directly operating by the activities of large financial institutions. Moreover, the closing of the Institutional Hour Session often sets the stage for the Extended Hour Trading Session, where trading continues under different market conditions, typically marked by lower liquidity and higher volatility.

#### Signal Generation
**Signal Generation** in trading is the process by which advanced trading systems identify opportunities to buy or sell assets based on specific criteria or patterns derived from market data, more specifically the SMA outfits. This form of signal generation leverages quantitative models that integrates SMA data to fine-tune the timing and accuracy of trades. By focusing on SMA outfits, the signal generation process ensures that all trading actions are precisely aligned with organization, thereby maximizing the efficiency and profitability of trades. This exclusive reliance on SMA-based signal generation highlights its critical role in shaping the financial institution, ensuring that each trading decisions are backed by robust and predictive analytical science.

#### Monitoring Market Sessions

- **Institutional vs. Extended Hours**: Arbitrage detection systems are meticulously designed to monitor and react to transitions between the SMA Outfit detection to operate on either the institutional trading hour and extended trading hour session. These periods often exhibit different liquidity and volatility characteristics, which impact arbitrage models. The systems are configured to dynamically adjust their strategies based on real-time market data to capitalize on unique conditions presented during either session. This adaptability ensures optimal execution of SMA strategies, maximizing efficiency and profitability for aggressive firms during transitioning market conditions.

## The Systems

This section provides context for the array of systems that contribute to the organization of the major market.

### Overview

Equity vehicles utilize every SMA outfit. The primary influence that enables wealth firms to adjust equities higher and lower are called “Systems”. This includes the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones Industrial on their respective midterm charts. None of the SMA outfits are specific to any vehicle; it is important to note that protocols exist specifically for the SPX 30M [10/50/200], IXIC 20M/30M [20/100/250], and DJI 15M/1H [30/60/90/300/600/900]. These are reflected as midterm trend based algorithms for buying and selling protocols on the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and Dow Jones.

These singular baseline SMA functions lack utility without access to the broader machinations that operate price action. This is because the system's effectiveness is not limited to a single protocol. Other Parameter Limitations and Precision Buy Algorithms play a critical role in structuring public equities. These additional factors contribute to a push-and-pull dynamic, effectively creating a 'fill in the bucket' game between various equity vehicles. The incorporation of Precision Buying Algorithms are executed to gamify and manage these interactions, ensuring a more sophisticated and coordinated public market.

### Defining the Systems

#### The S&P 500 - 10/50/200
The first and unequivocal SMA outfit is the 10/50/200 combination, known in the industry as 'The System.' This outfit is proprietary to the SPX, the index that measures the stock performance of the largest 500 companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges, and is applied to the SPX's 30-minute chart. This generalized parameter gauge sets the stage for the S&P 500's midterm buying and selling operations. There is substantial evidence that the real-time significance of buying/selling/short operations occurs when the S&P is either positive or negative.

A positive S&P 500 indicates that the MA10 trades above the MA50, while a negative S&P indicates that the MA10 trades below the MA50. During heightened volatility, such as a rising volatility index, these parameters shift to a candle close with price stimulation above the MA50 or liquidation below the MA50.

#### The NASDAQ - 20/100/250
The second SMA outfit introduces an escalation of complexity. This outfit, proprietary to the NASDAQ, is selected for the IXIC, which reflects the Nasdaq composite. During periods of overperformance and underperformance, the NASDAQ alternates between the 20-minute chart and the 30-minute chart. Wealth managers have organized this configuration as a nod to the NASDAQ's first proprietary SMA integer, 20. The bifurcation, or branching of a second timeframe, is the product of a cryptographic practice as a nod to innovation and structure.

A positive NASDAQ indicates that the MA20 trades above the MA100, while a negative NASDAQ indicates that the MA20 trades below the MA100. During heightened volatility, such as a rising volatility index, these parameters shift to a candle close with price stimulation above the MA100 or liquidation below the MA100.

#### The Dow Jones Industrial -30/60/90/300/600/900
The third SMA outfit is proprietary to the Dow Jones Industrial index (DJI). The positive and negative system functions are operated on the 15-minute and 1-hour charts. This configuration reflects the U.S. institutional hour session, which operates for 6 hours and 30 minutes, or 390 minutes. This protocol also serves as a nod to the significance of both time and the number three in public equities. The utility of both timeframes enables wealth firms to strategically structure and budget according to specific time requirements.

A positive Dow Jones Industrial indicates that the MA90 trades above the MA300, while a negative Dow Jones indicates that the MA90 trades below the MA300. During heightened volatility, such as a rising volatility index, these parameters shift to a candle close with price stimulation above the MA300 or liquidation below the MA300.


### Added Context

When the S&P 500 hits its MA200, the NASDAQ reaches its MA250, and the Dow Jones hits its MA900, these movements serve as key determinants of market outcomes, indicating recoveries or downturns.

When any of these systems are negative, the largest wealth firms are reaping profits, and some are shorting the market. As the S&P 500 is negative, the lack of structure results in massive liquidation events. No firm steps in before major institutions like JPM, BoA, Wells Fargo, BlackRock, and Citadel unless they are providing liquidity. U.S. stock market crashes only happen when the S&P 500's SPX is negative.


### Note
This work does not allow for any utility without the application of abject precision in arbitrage detection. The entire framework of U.S. equity markets operates specifically on the precision of these arbitrage detections and the outlined parameters. Any market activity outside of this defined scope is fundamentally based on guessing or unoptimized approaches, not supported by the actual framework of the public equity markets.

A "ticker" or "ticker symbol" is a unique series of letters assigned to a security for trading purposes on stock exchanges. Each ticker symbol represents a specific stock, ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), or other financial instrument and is used by traders and investors to uniquely identify and trade that security. For example, the ticker symbol "SPY" represents the S&P 500 ETF, which tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index, and "MSFT" stands for Microsoft Corporation. Tickers are essential for executing trades on electronic financial markets and are used globally to streamline and standardize the process of buying and selling shares.

These datasets are stored in highly structured formats to facilitate complex statistical analysis, supporting both time-series analyses and real-time manufactured events.

They are typically normalized to ensure accuracy and reliability in statistical modeling and machine learning applications used in predictive analytics and algorithmic trading strategies. Aggressive trading operations are implemented with extremely calculated budgets.

These selections involve multiple simultaneous operations, as wealth entities leverage specific SMA configurations to exploit market efficiencies using singular selections on a singular SMA outfit, singular timeframe, and leading instruments (equities, ETFs, Bonds, Treasuries, indices). It's important to clarify that these operations optimize market efficiencies, NOT market "inefficiencies", a concept often misinterpreted through traditional definitions of arbitrage.

The precision of these SMA Outfits, operating in real time, forge capital flows across the U.S's financial vehicles, including the DXY dollar, volatility indices, individual equities, bonds/treasuries, leading ETFs, and major indices like the NASDAQ, S&P 500, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, along with their tangential ProShare ETFs. This systematized framework is the foundation of U.S. public equity markets which rely on precision and effectiveness of SMA outfits in exploiting equity movements for profit, both in upward and downward movements at a multitude of frequencies.

The real-time, threaded, sharing of the analysis is proving to be pivotal in demanding transparency of the public equity markets. By openly sharing the operations of Simple Moving Average (SMA) configurations across 44,000 real-time instances, this body of work provides not just snapshots but a continuous, live-streamed narrative detailing how precision moves in the stock market can be mapped and predicted. This extensive evidence serves as direct proof of consistent, measurable mechanics of specific SMA setups operating the entire automated financial landscape.
